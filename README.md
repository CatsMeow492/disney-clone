# Disney+ Clone

Hi there,

This is a clone of the Disney+ website. Complete with reactive login functionality and live content. I primarily built this project to experiment and deepen my understanding of `styled-components` and firebase. The app itself is built with React-Redux frontend on a NodeJS backend and features a firebase JSON (NoSQL) database.  Feel free to use it as a reference if you'd like to try to do a Disney+ clone yourself.  They make for great portfolio projects.

# Getting Started

To scaffold the project using npx:

```
npx create-react-app disney-clone
```

To add all of the dependencies:

```
yarn add styled-components
yarn add react-router-dom
yarn add firebase
yarn add firebase-tools
yarn add react-redux
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
yarn add react-slick
yarn add slick-carousel
```

Finally, to compile and run a local instance:

```
yarn start
```
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
